    <h1>TOURISM IN CANNES</h1>

    <img src="/1463566195.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Quite simply because it is steeped in history dating back nearly
         one thousand years, Cannes has a soul. A history made from numerous fragments that
          it has preserved intact. In 1915, it was classified as a seaside resort by ministerial decree. Nowadays, Cannes is a trendy destination not only for its well-known red carpets and famous steps but there are much more to discover. Cannes is a holiday location prized by the great and good of this world. But there's something 
          about Cannes that makes it unique. Indeed, Cannes is a first
         rate international destination, which after several decades of tourism has developed a strong cosmopolitan character.</p>

    <p>Located 25 minutes from Nice international airport, it is 
        the city for festivals and major congresses, a shopping paradise, the capital of the silver screen and 
        a tourist city boasting exceptional host infrastructures. Cannes is the leading city in terms of business tourism 
        after Paris, it has built its fame on the know-how and first rate facilities that make it a competitive location, 
        preferred by the biggest international events. The well-known Croisette, with its luxury boutiques, palace hotels and Palais des Festivals, has bestowed prosperity and international fame on Cannes. But the city has not forgotten its popular origins. Le Suquet (Suquet district) and the Vieux Port (Old Port) continue to embody Provencal authenticity in the very heart of the most cosmopolitan of cities. A “pointu” fishing boat coming into the port, a market stall in Forville, a lane in the Suquet district, a game of pétanque on the Place de l’Etang a stone’s throw from the chic buildings on the Croisette, a walk on the Lerins islands or a climb up the steps of the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès. These fragments are also its small architectural treasures.
