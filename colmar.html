    <h1>TOURISM IN COLMAR</h1>

    <img src="colmar.jpg" alt="">

    <p>The city offers visitors a fascinating insight into 1,000 years
         of European history through its exceptional heritage. Wonderfully preserved from the ravages
          of time, its homogenous historical centre is classed as a 'protected area' and has benefited from careful restoration
         and ongoing improvements for more than 25 years.</p>
         <p>
            Colmar is really a condensed version of the Alsace region. Walking in its streets is like visiting Ã  huge movie set with 
            hundreds of century-old half-timbered houses, lovely canals and flourished pedestrian town center. The city has an impressive selection of quality restaurants and shops selling high-quality local products..
