        The city of Cordoba boasts a wealth of cultural and monumental heritage bequeathed to it by the
         different civilisations that have settled here. In 1994 UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
          Organisation) recognised the universal importance of its historical patrimony and extended
           the World Heritage Site
         to include not only the Mosque but also its surrounding urban area</p>

Cordoba's Mosque is an exceptional example of religious Islamic architecture and the most important witness to the 
Cordoba Caliphate. During this period it is said that the city had over 300 mosques and countless palaces, rivalling 
in splendour cities such as Constantinople and Baghdad. The Mosque's size and majestic height, which have never been equalled, make it a unique artistic work and one
 that played an essential role
 in the emergence of the neo-Islamic style of the 19th century
